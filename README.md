# tech-titans-vs-market-volatility
This project analyzes the resilience of major technology companies — Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia — during key global economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation-driven selloffs. It compares their performance against broader market indices: the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).

# Objective
To investigate how "tech titans" respond to market volatility, and whether they perform better or worse than the general market during crisis periods. We use stock price data from Yahoo Finance to analyze returns, volatility, and trends from 2020 to 2024.
